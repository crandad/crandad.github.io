<p> As you may recently know, the final character of the first Super Smash Brothers Ultimate DLC Pack has came out. This, had led to negative and slightly postive feedback.
<br>
In the end, chaos and destruction was released. 
<br>
But you make ask, how is each character in general? (or you might not ask)
<br>
<br>
Joker: Joker From Persona 5 was a beloved fan reveal. Many praised Nintendo for this decision, due to having a non-nintendo representative. Joker features one of his personas, Arcene in the game. 9/10, gave what most fans wanted.
<br>
<br>
Hero: Hero from the Dragon Quest series was revealed to some dismay. Many were letdown in a way that they wanted someone 'bigger'. Of course, others partied, spamming all over social media. 7/10, due to great animation reveal, and fun character with unique gimic.
<br>
<br>
Banjo & Kazooie: When the Bear and Bird were revealed, many partied with excitement. The characters have not been seen for a while, and were remade from the ground-up for Super Smash Bros Ultimate. They were a Microsoft representative, due to Microsoft owning the company RARE. 8.5/10
<br>
<br>
Terry Bogard: Terry Bogard orginating from the Fatal Fury series came out of nowhere, other than a leak on the official website with a copyright of the parent company. Although, many were fine with this character, and he was a fun editon. 7.5/10
<br>
<br>
Byleth: Byleth orginating from Fire Emblem Three Houses came along the final character slot, and many were upset. They claimed there were too many Fire Emblem Characters already present in the game. The character, however was unique. They are a fun edtion. 8.5/10
<br>
