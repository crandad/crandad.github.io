<p> Now, consoles are at an all time high. This year the Playstation 5 and Xbox Series X will release and fans will flock to them. However, many fought each other for the simple question: Which console is superior? To that I say, none are. Consoles all together make a great system if you think about. Fans will buy more consoles, and the market grows. Also, it spawned a lot of company twitter arguments. </p>
